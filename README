This is the NDGF APEL Reporting tool.

It extracts accounting information from an SGAS coreinfo view in CouchDB, and
builds reports for insertion into the APEL database.

See the comment in the top of apel-reporter for how to use the tool. Usually
the tool will just run via cron, but it also has an interactive mode (-i).

Requires the python mysql module (package name: python-mysqldb in ubuntu)
